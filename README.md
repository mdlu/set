### Memory Scramble or Possibly Set

Rules: 
- first person to click a card blocks other players until they have clicked 3 cards, player has a certain time limit to complete their set (something short, like 3sec?)
- some sort of penalty if the 3 cards are not a set, to discourage random clicking
- mechanism for adding 3 cards if nobody can find a set, perhaps require everyone to vote to agree (consider: odds of there not being a set in 18 cards? 21 cards? and adjusting game/UI accordingly)

Thoughts:
- do we want autocomplete on the 3rd card, like the other guy's implementation? (personally not a huge fan, isn't super true to the original game)
- implementing some sort of hint mechanism? (if people can't find a Set)
- scoreboard, scoring mechanism? (should there be any time element involved?)
- customizable shapes/colors/etc?
- stuff shamelessly stolen from Jenna on the cpw discord: https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/SetsPlanetsAndComets.pdf, apparently any group of 12 cards is guaranteed a planet, comet, or set? :O also multidimensional set -- variant where you duplicate all cards 3 times and add a border color as a 5th distinguishing characteristic, could be fun
- shuffling two decks together maybe?
